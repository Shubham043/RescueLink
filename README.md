# 🆘 RescueLink — Emergency Response System

> Built after the 2023 Himachal Pradesh floods where people lost their lives because emergency services couldn't locate victims in time.

## The Problem

In July 2023, catastrophic floods hit Himachal Pradesh. People were stranded, roads were cut off, and communication networks were severely damaged. Many victims couldn't reach emergency services — and even when they did, rescuers had no way to locate them precisely.

I watched this happen and thought: *there has to be a better way.*

RescueLink is my answer to that problem.

## What It Does

Two types of users, one shared mission:

### Victims (no login required)
- Hit the SOS button in seconds — no signup friction during an emergency
- Share emergency type, contact number, and live location
- Get redirected to a tracking page showing their rescuer moving towards them in real time

### Rescuers / NGOs (authenticated)
- See all active emergencies on a live map dashboard
- Accept emergencies with race-condition-safe atomic operations
- Share live location with victim while navigating to them
- Mark emergencies as resolved

---

## Demo Flow

```
1. Open app as victim → hit SOS → fill details → submit
2. Open dashboard as rescuer → see alert appear in real time
3. Accept emergency → both victim and rescuer see each other on map
4. Rescuer navigates to victim → resolves emergency
5. Victim sees "Help has arrived!" on tracking page
```

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Frontend | React + Vite | Fast dev, component reuse |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Rapid UI without custom CSS |
| Maps | Leaflet + React-Leaflet | Open source, no API key cost |
| Real-time | Socket.io | Native WebSocket support, rooms |
| Backend | Node.js + Express 5 | Event-driven, perfect for real-time |
| Database | MongoDB + Mongoose | Geospatial indexing (2dsphere) |
| Auth | JWT (jsonwebtoken) | Stateless, works across web + mobile |
| Validation | Joi | Schema-based input validation |
| Security | Helmet + Rate Limiting | Production hardening |
| Deployment | Vercel + Render | Free tier, auto-deploy from GitHub |

## Architecture

```
Victim's Browser          Rescuer's Browser
      |                         |
      | HTTP POST /api/SOS      | HTTP PATCH /api/SOS/:id/accept
      |                         |
      ▼                         ▼
   Express API  ←————————————————
      |         JWT Middleware
      |
      ├── MongoDB (Alert + User models)
      |
      └── Socket.io
            |
            ├── io.emit("newAlert")           → all rescuer dashboards
            ├── io.to(room).emit("alertAccepted") → specific victim only
            └── io.in(room).emit("rescuerLocationUpdate") → victim + rescuer
```

### Socket Rooms Strategy
Each emergency gets its own isolated Socket.io room `alert:${alertId}`. This means:
- Rescuer's live location is only sent to **their assigned victim**
- Not broadcasted to all users
- Privacy + performance — no unnecessary events

---

## Key Engineering Decisions

### 1. Race Condition Prevention
Two rescuers accepting the same emergency simultaneously is a real scenario. Solved with MongoDB's atomic `findOneAndUpdate`:

```js
// Only succeeds if status is STILL "active" at query time
// MongoDB processes this atomically — one rescuer wins, other gets null
const alert = await Alert.findOneAndUpdate(
  { _id: id, status: "active" },
  { status: "acknowledged", acceptedBy: rescuerId },
  { new: true }
);
```

### 2. No Auth for Victims
Deliberately chose NOT to require login for SOS submission. During a flood or medical emergency, asking someone to create an account costs lives. Rescuers authenticate — victims don't.

### 3. Live Location at 5-Second Intervals
```js
// Industry standard (same as Uber, Zomato)
// Accurate enough for emergency navigation
// Battery friendly — not watchPosition which fires 10-20x/sec
 
```

### 4. JWT Over Cookies
Chose Bearer tokens in Authorization headers because the app is designed to eventually support mobile clients. Cookies work well for browser-only apps but JWT works across web, mobile, and API clients.

### 5. Geospatial Indexing
```js
alertSchema.index({ location: "2dsphere" });
// Enables efficient "find alerts near me" queries
// Critical for scaling to city/state level
```

## Running Locally

### Backend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham043/RescueLink_Backend
cd RescueLink_Backend
npm install
```

Create `.env`:
```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
PORT=8000
```

```bash
npm start
```

### Frontend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubham043/RescueLink_Frontend
cd RescueLink_Frontend
npm install
```

Create `.env`:
```
VITE_API_ENV=local
VITE_LOCAL_HOST=http://localhost:8000
VITE_HOSTED_URL=https://rescuelink-backend.onrender.com
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] PWA + offline SOS submission (service workers + background sync)
- [ ] SMS fallback via Twilio — works with no internet, just one text
- [ ] Max active acceptances per rescuer (limit to 3)
- [ ] Auto-release if rescuer goes offline after accepting
- [ ] HttpOnly cookies for better XSS protection
- [ ] Live location history trail on map
- [ ] NDRF / State disaster management API integration

## Why I Built This

I'm from Himachal Pradesh. In 2023 I watched the floods destroy homes, roads, and lives. The thing that stayed with me wasn't the destruction — it was the helplessness. People knew help existed but couldn't connect with it fast enough.

RescueLink is my attempt to close that gap. It's not just a portfolio project — it's a problem I actually want to solve.
